AutoPruner
==========

Save RAM by pruning files from your KSP installation, and hiding them from the loader.

How to use:

Run the StartThis.bat batch file to open a command prompt in this directory.
run:
  pruner -prune FASA_Tanks.prnl
To prune all FASA tanks defined in the prunelist (.prnl)
run:
  pruner -unprune FASA_Tanks.prnl
To undo what you did, since you realized that you really did want those tanks.
